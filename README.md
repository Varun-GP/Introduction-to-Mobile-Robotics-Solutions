# Introduction-to-Mobile-Robotics-Solutions
Introduction to Mobile Robotics (engl.) - Autonomous Mobile Systems: University of Freiburg

My learnings and attempt to solve excercises of the course [http://ais.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/teaching/ss19/robotics/index_en.php]. 
This course will introduce basic concepts and techniques used within the field of mobile robotics. We analyze the fundamental challenges for autonomous intelligent systems and present the state of the art solutions. 
Among other topics, we will discuss:      
1) Kinematics
2) Sensors     
3) Vehicle localization
4) Map building
5) SLAM
6) Path planning
